<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Leak Detector</li><li>Active Leak Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water leak detectors market comprises two main types: passive and active leak detectors. Passive leak detectors are designed to monitor areas for moisture without actively initiating alerts; they typically rely on electrical resistance or capacitive sensing to identify leaks. In contrast, active leak detectors actively engage in leak detection by incorporating sensors that trigger alerts or alarms when water is detected. Both types offer essential solutions for preventing water damage and minimizing maintenance costs in residential and commercial properties.</p></p>
